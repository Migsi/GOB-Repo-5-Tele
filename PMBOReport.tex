\section{Introduction}



    This is the basis for the resulting LaTeX file.
    Everyone should write 2 to 4 pages on an assigned topic, and finally push it to this repository, to create a handbook on various tools
    for distributed project and software management.
    
    The document should be structured into an introduction, a section for each topic group (e.g. versioning systems, issue trackers, forums and wikis,\ldots)
    In each of these sectoins, subsections have to contain the contributions of the single students.

    At the end, everything needs to be pulled to the teacher's GOBRepo (by filling a pull request).
